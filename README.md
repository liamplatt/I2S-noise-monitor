1. Project Overview 
1.1 Project Outline 

Our project consists of an integrated noise monitoring system designed to be utilized in residential spaces where noise can have a lasting and detrimental impact on residents. Specifically, this project is aimed at controlling and monitoring the often-excessive noise found in on-campus dormitory housing. The health effects of such noise are quantifiable by long-term hearing loss, disturbance of sleep and rest, social and behavioral problems, as well as temporary and permanent physiological and psychological conditions.  

Our aims are to both reduce the work of residential staff and improve student housing on campus by streamlining the way in which noise complaints are handled. By utilizing a system of noise monitors spread throughout a building, residential staff can be notified when a resident is not following the University policies with regards to “quiet hours”. These are policies that restrict excessive noise late at night and are included in the University's 2020-2021 Student Handbook [5]. The noise monitoring units will be integrated through a centralized dashboard which serves as a secured database for noise level readings and as an interactive webpage for residential assistants.  

The main target user of this project is residential staff. They are the ones who will be interacting directly with our system. The dashboard website itself will serve as their point of contact and all operations such as viewing data, notifying residents, and checking status’ will be done through it. This allows residential advisors to actively address noise from anywhere and make informed decisions about reoccurring problems. 

1.2 Project Background 

As mentioned previously, noise pollution can have short term and long-term side effects. For a student, such effects can be amplified- with lack of sleep and rest being linked to decreased academic performance. Psychological effects such as anxiety, depression, and stress can cause significant issues in personal wellbeing, to an already vulnerable population. In fact, the World Health Organization lists those “dealing with complex cognitive tasks” as a particularly vulnerable subgroup. Because of the reliance on studying done out of class during the COVID-19 pandemic this has further become an issue for students trying to succeed in their coursework. 

At the University of Hartford in particular, a few major sources were found to have contributed the most to noise pollution on campus. Noise created by sources such as construction, road noise, large gatherings, and entertainment systems play a detrimental role in student wellbeing. While road noise is a major contributor, existing dormitories can’t be moved and adding any sort of sound dampening measures is oftentimes costly, especially in older historic buildings. Activities related to construction also, admittedly, play a huge role in noise pollution but are often in aim of improving campus life for students. Our project takes aim at the later of the two sources in hopes of improving student life and academic performance. 

Since college dormitory housing is often tightly packed with adjacent units, the idea of noise monitoring as both a measure of wellbeing and as a deterrent becomes much more reasonable. With most noise complaints being handled by residential advisors the act of policing overly detrimental noise pollution is a challenging task. RAs at the University of Hartford are expected to uphold quiet hours from 10p.m.-10a.m. on weeknights and from 1a.m.-10a.m. on weekends[5]. This can become a taxing duty with residential staff having to address noise complaints that occur at any time of the night.  

As with any project, overall impact and the ethical implications that follow were considered and used to guide overall design. One such ethical implication was privacy. This is common thread in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects and becomes particularly problematic when the sensor involved is a microphone. Specifically, for this project, concerns around unwanted ‘listening-in’ or monitoring of audio in residential spaces were raised. Because of this, certain design decisions were made to preserve privacy and create a secure network of sensors.  

1.3 Objectives 

Our objective for this project was to design a low-cost network of noise monitoring devices capable of measuring equivalent noise levels within a dormitory setting. As part of this, one working prototype noise monitor was to be fully constructed. To prove the capability of our project as a full-scale integrated system, such as the one in Figure 1.3.1, multiple noise monitors were implemented on breadboard as well. An interactive website for Residential Assistants to view noise levels; both current and past was also constructed. This serves as the point-of-contact for the user to login, notify residents, and view other information pertinent to residential life staff.   

1.4 Attributions

Work on this project was done by Paul Wehbe, Rich Patino, and Liam Platt. Liam Platt is an Audio Engineering Technology student with a passion for audio processing, both digital and analog. His work area included the design, development, and implementation of the noise monitors themselves. Liam also worked on developing testing suites for said noise monitors.  

Paul Wehbe is an Electrical Engineering student with a passion in communications and signal processing also both digital and analog. His work area throughout the project included contributions in the design of the noise monitors dashboard, which included the designing of the authenticated login/logout, front-end development using Adobe XD and Webflow, and working on developing the charts used within the dashboard.  

Rich Patino is a Computer Engineering student with an interest in computer programming and hardware implementation. His work area throughout the project included commitments to creating back-end development with Google Firebase and Microsoft Visual Studio, design of the live dashboard web application, and developing email and text message system that was used to notify the resident.
